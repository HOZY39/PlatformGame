# Platform Game

This project was created around 2019 when I was 16 years old.  
Everything (except for the menu image) was made by me.  

## Game Overview
This is a platform game with several levels. The goal is to reach the chicken at the end of each level.

## Features

- **Goal**: The main objective is to navigate through the levels and reach the chicken.
- **Graphics**: All graphics were created by me (except for the menu image).

## How to Play
1. Move your character through the platform levels.
2. Avoid obstacles (fire).
3. Reach the chicken to complete the level!
